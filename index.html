      <p>My Name is Ben, I began coding as a hobby, completing evening courses and self directed learning and I’ve since made the leap into unfamiliar territory by challenging myself to build knowledge and transferable skills for both personal and professional development. A strong work ethic has always been instilled in me and I aim to set a good example for my 2 young boys that they can achieve anything they set their minds to if they follow their dreams by doing their very best and hard work.<br><br>
        I’ve always been active and love travelling to develop my exploration and I have been lucky to have the opportunity to do this through both snowboarding and rugby league. In America, I was privileged to have the experience to develop and present rugby league as a growing sport and link my passion with profession and this is what I strive to achieve with coding.</p>
